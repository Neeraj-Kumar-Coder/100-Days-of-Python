# 100-Days-of-Python
Target is to learn python from scratch in 100 Days of coding in python.

## Days Target
- #### Day 001: Introduction to Python
- #### Day 002: Introduction about Modules in Python
- #### Day 003: Created our first python program
- #### Day 004: Learned about print() arguments (non essentials) and escape sequence characters
- #### Day 005: Learned about variables and data types (in python everything is an object)
- #### Day 006: Created a basic calculator in python (expression support: a op b)
- #### Day 007: Basic calculator solution on this day
- #### Day 008: Learned about typecasting in python (Implicit and Explicit Typecasting)
- #### Day 009: Learned to take input in python using the input() method (it takes the input in the form of string)
- #### Day 010: Learned about basics of string and looping through it using for-in loop
- #### Day 011: String slicing (with negative index slicing)
- #### Day 012: Learned about methods in strings
- #### Day 013: Conditional statements in python (if, if-else, if-elif-else ladder)
- #### Day 014: Learned about time module in python and implemented a simple program based on it
- #### Day 015: Learned the new addition of python's match-case statement (introduced from python 3.10)
- #### Day 016: Started loops and learned about for loops (works on iterable objects)
- #### Day 017: Learned while loop and while-else feature
- #### Day 018: Break and Continue in loops (empulation of do-while loop in python)
- #### Day 019: Started functions also learned about the 'pass' keyword
- #### Day 020: Learned various ways of passing arguments to functions (5 ways: Required, Default, Keyword, Variable length as tuple, Variable length as dictionary)
- #### Day 021: Learned about list in python (including List Comprehensions, to generate list on the fly)
- #### Day 022: List methods (append(), concat(), extend(), copy(), insert(), count(), index() and more...)
- #### Day 023: Learned about methods in tuple (similar slicing and all but tuples are immutable)
- #### Day 024: Learned various operations in tuple (method to change a tuple by converting to list, index(), count() etc...)
- #### Day 025: Get the solution of "Good Morning Sir" exercise (use of time module and time formatting)
- #### Day 026: Created a KBC app using the concepts learned till now
- #### Day 027: Learned f-strings in python (python 3.6 onwards)
- #### Day 028: Learned about 'Docstring' and 'The Zen of Python' (by 'import this')
- #### Day 029: Recursion in python [factorial() and fibonacci() example]
- #### Day 030: Learned about sets in python
- #### Day 031: Learned about different methods in sets
